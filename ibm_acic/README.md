# IBM ACIC 
This identifier refers to the dataset presented [on synapse.org](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn11738767/wiki/512854)

# Covariates 
The covariates are taken from the LBIDD (Linked Births and Infant Deaths Database) Database. 
There are 100.000 instances in this dataset

# Outcomes
The authors of the dataset provide 64 different Data Generating Processes (DGP) on the covariates. 
For each DGP, there are a differing number of replications, with different sizes and parameters. The various DGPs are described in detailed here: https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn11738767/wiki/512854 (check out the `scaling_params.csv` file). 
Here we only present 50 replications for `DGP == 1`
